# HumanBenchmark AI Challenges

This repository hosts Node.js programs designed to tackle challenges from Human Benchmark. Each AI for a specific challenge resides in its own branch.

## Overview

Human Benchmark offers cognitive challenges for measuring and enhancing human performance. This repository contains Node.js-based AI solutions for automating and excelling in these challenges.

## Work finished

The project is finished on my side, the code is not perfect and most of the loops need's to be done cleanly but I can get 100% in all of the challenges and I'm fine with it :)

Was a fun way to start my learning of OpenCV, Tesseract, RobotJs and Nut.js

Some of the code was done on a Macbook, the rest of it on a 1080p screen for reference
