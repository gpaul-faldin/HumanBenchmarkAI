# HB-chimp

This project is doing the Chimp test from Human Benchmark using computer vision (openCV) for the detection of the different squares, tesseract is used for the OCR of each number on the squares and robotjs for the interactions

I also use AlterCam to make a virtual webcam of my screen to get a liveCapture instead of relying on screen capture
